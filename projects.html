## Projects

I've been fortunate to work on a couple academic projects during my schooling. 

### BlueSync: Time Synchronization via Bluteooth Low Energy

This was the capstone project for my master's degree at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under the guidance of Professor Mani Srivastava, I designed and implemented a time synchronization protocol for BLE devices, utilizing custom GATT profiles and creative use of BLE advertisements. 

As part of the project, I had to write firmware for the BlueGiga BLE112 BLE module, which is available [on the ARM mbed developer portal](https://developer.mbed.org/users/dishbreak/code/BGLib/).

For an in-depth look at the project, please find it [on my GitHub](https://github.com/dishbreak/bluesync).

### Interactive CLI

For my Operating Systems course at UCLA, we needed to implement a custom CLI from scratch, including the following features:

Interactive editing

Command history

Tab completion

Signal handling

Job control

For the design document, please click [here](/files/DesignProjectPaper.pdf).

Unfortunately, for the sake of future students, our professor asked us not to share our source code. 

### Arduino Home Automation

This was the final project for my bachelor's degree at the University of California, San Diego. Along with a lab partner, I designed and built a home automation system powered by an Arduino Microcontroller which controlled lights using the X10 lighting control system and a home theater setup using LEDs. We even built a web server using PHP to control the Arduino. When we set out on this project back in 2010, we didn't realize we were building an IoT solution.

For the paper describing our project, click [here](/files/Final_Manual.pdf). For the source code, please find it on [my GitHub](https://github.com/dishbreak/homeduino).

For the YouTube video where we demonstrated the project, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRZ9pis_Kyw). Please remember that cinematography isn't one of my strengths. :)

### Presentations

I've made a couple presentations. Here are ones I'm able to share publicly.
