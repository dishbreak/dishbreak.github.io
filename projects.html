## Projects

I've been fortunate to work on a couple academic projects during my schooling. 

### BlueSync: Time Synchronization via Bluteooth Low Energy

This was the capstone project for my master's degree at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under the guidance of Professor Mani Srivastava, I designed and implemented a time synchronization protocol for BLE devices, utilizing custom GATT profiles and creative use of BLE advertisements. 

For an in-depth look at the project, please find it [on my GitHub](https://github.com/dishbreak/bluesync).

### Arduino Home Automation

This was the final project for my bachelor's degree at the University of California, Los Angeles.
