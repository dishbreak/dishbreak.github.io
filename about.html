## About

Hi! My name is Vishal Kotcherlakota. I'm a software engineer by trade. I've had plenty of experience in and around IT, ranging from development to operations and everything in between. I'm a huge fan of DevOps, becuae I think it's the next logical step for Agile development. 

In my spare time, I like tinkering and playing with different things, ranging from web development to microcontrollers and IoT.
