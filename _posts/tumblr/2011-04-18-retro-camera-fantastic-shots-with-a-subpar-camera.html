<p>You may have noticed I&rsquo;ve recently uploaded a few pictures to Tumblr. These pictures all have a few things in common: they&rsquo;ve been taken with my cellphone with an app for Android called <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=org.urbian.android.tools.vintagecam&amp;feature=search_result">Retro Camera</a>. This is part of a challenge to myself, but there are a few rules involved.<!-- more --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a fascination with photography. The idea of using existing light and shadow to capture art is a powerful concept. The art that I want to make when I take photos already exists in the real world. I just need to find it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to justify buying a nicer camera like a DSLR or a high-end point-and-shoot, but I&rsquo;m not really convinced that I&rsquo;ll use it all that much yet. So my challenge to myself is to take photos so that I can select one to share at least 3-5 photos per week. The rules are simple:</p>
<ol><li>Photos must be taken with my cellphone camera. This camera is low-fidelity, and has no optical zoom. This limitation forces me to compose shots with subject matter that&rsquo;s interesting.</li>
<li>I must be able to communicate a thought or idea with each photo I take. This keeps me from copping out and taking photos for the sake of it.</li>
<li>No food photos. They&rsquo;re way too easy and I&rsquo;d rather not eat out that often. :-(</li>
<li>If there are people in the shot, it must be candid.</li>
</ol><p>We&rsquo;ll see how long these rules, and this challenge, last. </p>
